# :sparkles: Hello! :sparkles:

Welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Freddie and I'm currently an Engineer *at* GitHub working on the `AI & Data` team ðŸ“ˆ

## Background
My background is in building dev tools and systems for Data Science and Machine Learning, and I've worked in Quant Finance, AgTech, and E-Commerce, with focuses on Forecasting, Reinforcement Learning, and NLP systems. 

## Interests
These days, I'm looking to learn more about Coral Ecology (and also love to casually and competitively play Pokemon)

I enjoy using mechanical keyboards, and have been using a [Filco Majestouch 2](https://www.diatec.co.jp/en/det.php?prod_c=763) with Cherry MX Brown switches for the last 6 years as my daily driver (now with GMK Coral).

I'm now building a southpaw [ReLyra](https://github.com/PiKeeb/lyra-keyboard), named after the original Lyra keyboard which had a very interesting [controversy](https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=104916.msg3086583#msg3086583) that occurred. The `ReLyra` will be my new daily driver so I can retire my Filco (switches TBD!)
